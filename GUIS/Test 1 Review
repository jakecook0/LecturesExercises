Exam 1 Review (see canvas for other topics):
    *Events, Listeners, Bindings, javaFX*

    Bind: property to a property, called with bind
    	Uni-directional -- bind()
        bi-directional -- bindBidirectional()
    
    Event:
        generated by a NODE, handled by code:
			EventHandler{ handle() { //logic }}
        replaceable with a lmbda (e ->)
        types of event: action, key, mouse
            Mouse doesn't generate event, the NODE generates the event
		mouse clicked vs pressed/release (up to 3 events can be generated with mouse)

    Listeners:
		listens to a property
		code:
			ObservableValue { invalidated{ //logic } }
	
	ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WITH A BINDING YOU CAN DO WITH A LISTENER
	Rotation:
		any node can be rotated in javaFX
		rotate() uses pos values, arcs use negative vals to get pos 'rotation'
		arc smiley: start angle 180, draw for 180

	Starting GUI code:
		main()
		constructor()
		start()

	JAVA:
		extend 1 class, implement many
		Overloading vs Overriding (override is inheritence, comes from parent)
		3 Pillars:
			Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

		on children calls, parent content is always called first. super() refers to parent in inheritance

		automatic downcasting of method calls -- looks through child before parent
